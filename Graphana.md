# Log Management Tools and Grafana MCP Integration

## Log Management Platforms with Generous Free Tiers

### Most Generous
- **Grafana Loki + Grafana Cloud** - 50GB logs/month, 14-day retention
- **Datadog** - 1GB/day for 15 days (good for testing)
- **New Relic** - 100GB/month, 8-day retention

### Good Options
- **Elastic Cloud** - 14-day free trial, then paid
- **Papertrail** - 50MB/day, 7-day retention  
- **Logz.io** - 3GB/day for 3 days
- **Fluentd + self-hosted** - Completely free but requires setup

### Best Value
**Grafana Cloud** is the recommended choice - 50GB/month is quite generous for most development projects, and Grafana has excellent visualization tools.

### For Development
- **ELK Stack (self-hosted)** - Free but requires maintenance
- **Loki + Grafana (self-hosted)** - Lightweight alternative to ELK

## Grafana MCP Server Integration

Grafana has official MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that integrate with Claude Code:

### Available MCP Servers

**1. Grafana MCP Server** - Main server for Grafana integration
```bash
claude mcp add grafana npx -y @grafana/mcp-grafana
```

**2. Loki MCP Server** - Specifically for Grafana Loki logs
```bash  
claude mcp add loki npx -y @grafana/loki-mcp
```

### Features Available Through MCP

#### Dashboard Management
- **Search for dashboards**: Find dashboards by title or other metadata
- **Get dashboard by UID**: Retrieve full dashboard details using unique identifier
- **Update or create dashboards**: Modify existing dashboards or create new ones

#### Data Source Integration
- Search for dashboards
- Retrieve dashboard information
- List and query data sources (Prometheus, Loki)
- Query Prometheus and Loki metadata
- Manage Grafana incidents and alerts

#### Alert Management
- List and fetch alert rule information
- Monitor alert states and conditions

### Installation Requirements
- Grafana version 9.0 or later required for full functionality
- Compatible with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients

### Usage Modes
- **Docker**: SSE mode by default
- **Binary Installation**: Download from GitHub releases
- **Claude Desktop Integration**: STDIO mode for direct AI assistant integration

### Architecture
The Grafana MCP servers follow the Model Context Protocol standard, which enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources. MCP takes inspiration from the Language Server Protocol, standardizing how to integrate additional context and tools into AI applications.

### Current Status
- **Strong Adoption**: 153k downloads (4.6k weekly)
- **Official Support**: Maintained by Grafana Labs
- **Recent Development**: Released March 18, 2025
- **Community Support**: Active development and hackathon projects

## Benefits for Cuttlefish3 Project

Using Grafana MCP integration would provide:

1. **Natural Language Queries**: Query logs and metrics using plain English through Claude Code
2. **Dashboard Automation**: Create and modify dashboards programmatically
3. **Integrated Monitoring**: Combine log analysis with your RAG query platform
4. **Alert Management**: Set up and manage alerts for your system
5. **Data Visualization**: Automatically generate visualizations for query patterns and system performance

## Setup Process

1. **Terminal**: Add Grafana MCP servers
   ```bash
   claude mcp add grafana npx -y @grafana/mcp-grafana
   claude mcp add loki npx -y @grafana/loki-mcp
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   claude mcp list
   ```

3. **Configure Authentication**: Use `/mcp` command in Claude Code interface if needed

4. **Usage**: MCP tools become available automatically in Claude Code for natural language interaction with Grafana

This integration would be particularly valuable for monitoring the performance and usage patterns of your JIRA RAG Query Platform.
