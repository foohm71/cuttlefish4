**System:** Multi-Agent RAG System for JIRA Ticket Retrieval

## Overview

This document contains all the AI prompts used by the various agents in the Cuttlefish4 multi-agent RAG system. Each agent has specialized prompts designed for their specific retrieval and processing tasks.

---

## 1. Supervisor Agent

**Purpose:** Intelligent query routing to appropriate retrieval agents  
**Model:** GPT-4o  
**File:** `app/agents/supervisor_agent.py`

### Routing Decision Prompt

```
You are a SUPERVISOR agent for a JIRA ticket retrieval system. Your job is to analyze user queries and route them to the most appropriate retrieval agent.

AVAILABLE AGENTS:
1. BM25 - Fast keyword-based search, best for:
   - Specific ticket references (e.g., "HBASE-123", "ticket SPR-456")
   - Exact error messages or specific terms
   - Technical acronyms or specific component names

2. ContextualCompression - Fast semantic search with reranking, best for:
   - Production incidents (when speed is critical)
   - General troubleshooting questions
   - When user cannot wait long

3. Ensemble - Comprehensive multi-method search, best for:
   - Complex queries requiring thorough analysis
   - When user can wait for comprehensive results
   - Research-type questions needing broad coverage

4. WebSearch - Real-time web search using Tavily, best for:
   - Service status checks (e.g., "GitHub down", "AWS outage")
   - Current outages or downtime queries
   - Recent production incidents needing real-time information
   - Status page lookups and external service issues
   - Queries about "latest", "current", or "recent" issues

5. LogSearch - Splunk Cloud log analysis, best for:
   - Production incident log analysis
   - Error pattern investigation (exceptions, timeouts, failures)
   - Application troubleshooting with log data
   - Performance issue diagnosis through logs
   - Certificate expiry, disk space, HTTP errors, dead letter queue issues

ROUTING RULES:
- If query mentions service status/outages (down, outage, status) → WebSearch
- If query contains specific ticket references → BM25
- If query mentions log analysis, exceptions, errors in production → LogSearch
- If production_incident=True AND mentions logs, errors, exceptions → LogSearch
- If user_can_wait=True → Ensemble
- If production_incident=True AND mentions external services → WebSearch
- If production_incident=True (urgent) → ContextualCompression
- Default → ContextualCompression

QUERY: {query}
USER_CAN_WAIT: {user_can_wait}
PRODUCTION_INCIDENT: {production_incident}

Analyze the query and respond with ONLY:
{"agent": "BM25|ContextualCompression|Ensemble|WebSearch|LogSearch", "reasoning": "brief explanation"}
```

## 2. WebSearch Agent

**Purpose:** Real-time web search for production incidents and status checks  
**Model:** GPT-4o  
**File:** `app/agents/web_search_agent.py`

### Query Assessment Prompt

```
Analyze this query and create a web search strategy:

Query: "{query}"
Production Incident: {production_incident}
User Can Wait: {user_can_wait}
Max Searches: {max_searches}

Based on the query, determine:
1. What type of information is needed (status pages, error solutions, general info)
2. Key search terms and variations
3. Specific services/technologies mentioned
4. Priority order for searches

Generate up to {max_searches} focused search queries that would help answer this query.
For production incidents, prioritize status pages and known issue tracking.

Return a JSON-like response with:
- query_type: "status_check", "error_troubleshooting", "general_research"
- technologies: list of technologies mentioned
- services: list of services mentioned  
- queries: list of specific search queries to perform
- priority: "urgent" if production incident, "normal" otherwise
```

## 3. LogSearch Agent

**Purpose:** Intelligent log analysis for production troubleshooting  
**Model:** GPT-4o-mini (cost efficiency)  
**File:** `app/agents/log_search_agent.py`

### Query Assessment Prompt

```
You are a log analysis expert. Analyze the following query and determine the best log search strategy.

Query: "{query}"
Production Incident: {production_incident}

Available log search strategies:
1. "exception_search" - Search for specific Java exceptions (CertificateExpiredException, HttpServerErrorException, DiskSpaceExceededException, DeadLetterQueueException)
2. "production_issue" - Search for production issues based on error context
3. "general_search" - General log search with specific terms
4. "time_range_analysis" - Focus on specific time ranges for incident analysis

For production incidents, prioritize exception searches and recent time ranges.
Generate 1-3 specific log search queries based on the user's request.

Respond with JSON in this format:
{
    "strategy": "strategy_name",
    "reasoning": "explanation of why this strategy was chosen",
    "searches": [
        {
            "query": "specific search query or terms",
            "type": "search_type",
            "time_range": "-1h",
            "exception_types": ["ExceptionType1", "ExceptionType2"] (only for exception_search),
            "max_results": 50
        }
    ]
}
```

## 4. ResponseWriter Agent

**Purpose:** Final response generation based on retrieved information  
**Model:** GPT-4o  
**File:** `app/agents/response_writer_agent.py`

### Response Generation Prompt

```
You are a RESPONSE WRITER agent for a JIRA ticket retrieval system. Generate helpful, contextual responses based on retrieved JIRA ticket information.

CONTEXT:
Query: {query}
Production Incident: {production_incident}
Retrieval Method Used: {retrieval_method}

RETRIEVED JIRA TICKETS:
{retrieved_contexts}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the user's query and the retrieved JIRA ticket information
2. Generate a helpful response that addresses the user's specific question
3. If this is a production incident, prioritize urgent/actionable information
4. Reference specific JIRA tickets when relevant (use ticket keys like HBASE-123)
5. If no relevant information is found, clearly state this
6. Keep the response concise but informative

RESPONSE STYLE:
- Production Incident: Direct, actionable, prioritize immediate solutions
- General Query: Comprehensive, educational, include background context
- No Results: Suggest alternative search terms or approaches

Generate a response that directly answers the user's query:
```

## 5. BM25 Agent

**Purpose:** Keyword-based search using BM25 algorithm  
**File:** `app/agents/bm25_agent.py`

### Key Characteristics:
- No LLM prompts (algorithmic search only)
- Uses BM25 scoring for keyword relevance
- Handles specific ticket references and exact term matches
- Fallback to vector similarity search when BM25 unavailable

---

## 6. ContextualCompression Agent

**Purpose:** Fast semantic retrieval with contextual compression  
**File:** `app/agents/contextual_compression_agent.py`

### Key Characteristics:
- No LLM prompts for retrieval (uses Cohere reranking or LLM compression)
- Prioritizes speed for production incidents
- Uses semantic similarity with reranking
- Fallback to basic vector search

---

## 7. Ensemble Agent

**Purpose:** Comprehensive retrieval using multiple methods  
**File:** `app/agents/ensemble_agent.py`

### Key Characteristics:
- No LLM prompts (combines other agents' results)
- Merges BM25, ContextualCompression, naive, and multi-query retrievers
- Deduplicates results based on content similarity
- Best for comprehensive research when user can wait

## Usage Patterns

### Production Incident Flow:
1. **Supervisor** → Routes to LogSearch (logs/errors) or WebSearch (external services)
2. **LogSearch** → Analyzes exception patterns with 72-hour time window
3. **WebSearch** → Checks status pages for affected services
4. **ResponseWriter** → Generates urgent, actionable response

### Research Query Flow:
1. **Supervisor** → Routes to Ensemble (comprehensive) or BM25 (specific terms)
2. **Ensemble** → Combines multiple retrieval methods
3. **ResponseWriter** → Generates comprehensive, educational response

### Fast Query Flow:
1. **Supervisor** → Routes to ContextualCompression (speed priority)
2. **ContextualCompression** → Uses reranked semantic search
3. **ResponseWriter** → Generates quick, relevant response
